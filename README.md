# Geospatial_TimeSeries_Forecast
Time series prediction of peak activity across spatial areas

In this project, I aimed to find a solution to direct drivers towards areas of peak demand ahead of time. For this, I used a ride hailing dataset containing geospatial and temporal data. The notebook walks through the steps of data exploration in time and geographic space, data cleaning and preprocessing and finally modeling the time-series for partitioned spatial sections.
